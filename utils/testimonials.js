      "This is the only salon in Abuja that Iâ€™ve found does gel x nails (which are infinitely better for your nails than acrylic extensions). Kenneth is warm and professional and everyone else Iâ€™ve met who works at the salon has been friendly. Despite the 5 stars I must say, the salon interior could be better maintained - some parts of the wooden finishes are peeling, mirrors broken, etc. And the plaza itself is unfinished and sort of an eyesore. That I still patronize the business is a testament to the quality of the actual work and the customer-centric service of the salon.'(PS I also got microblading done here and itâ€™s coming out really nicely)'.",

      "This place is far better looking on the inside that the environment where it is looked. It is big, many staff, clean and inviting. They offer hair salon services, nail works, pedicure & manicure and makeup for regular and bridal. I will not consider this place as upscale as their prices are moderate. Their claim of 24hrs Operations is not fully true especially as regards to the makeup artist who may not be available due to home-services. I suggest you call them before arrival.  The quality of their is not in doubt and their customer service is exceptional. I can't vouch for their ability to keep to time.",
